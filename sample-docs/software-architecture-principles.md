# Software Architecture Principles

## SOLID Principles

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should have only one reason to change. Each class should have a single responsibility and encapsulate only the functionality related to that responsibility.

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. You should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code.

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without breaking the application.

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use. Create specific interfaces rather than one general-purpose interface.

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

## Microservices Best Practices

### Service Boundaries
- Define clear boundaries based on business capabilities
- Each service should own its data
- Minimize inter-service communication
- Design for failure and resilience

### Communication Patterns
- Use asynchronous messaging when possible
- Implement circuit breakers for external calls
- Consider event-driven architecture
- Use API gateways for external communication

### Data Management
- Database per service pattern
- Eventual consistency over ACID transactions
- Implement saga patterns for distributed transactions
- Use event sourcing for complex business logic

## Scalability Patterns

### Horizontal Scaling
- Design stateless applications
- Use load balancers effectively
- Implement database sharding
- Cache frequently accessed data

### Performance Optimization
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use CDNs for static content
- Optimize database queries
- Monitor and profile application performance
