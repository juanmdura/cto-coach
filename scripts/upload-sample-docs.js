        content: `# Software Architecture Principles

## Introduction
Software architecture is the foundation of any successful software system. It defines the structure, behavior, and interactions of system components.

## Key Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
Each component should have a single responsibility and should not be concerned with other components' internal workings.

### 2. Modularity
Break down complex systems into smaller, manageable modules that can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.

### 3. Scalability
Design systems to handle increased load gracefully through horizontal or vertical scaling.

### 4. Maintainability
Code should be written with future maintenance in mind, using clear naming conventions and documentation.

## Design Patterns

### Microservices Architecture
- Independent, loosely coupled services
- Each service owns its data
- Communication through well-defined APIs
- Enables independent deployment and scaling

### Event-Driven Architecture
- Components communicate through events
- Loose coupling between producers and consumers
- Enables real-time processing and scalability

## Best Practices
- Start simple and evolve the architecture
- Use established patterns and frameworks
- Document architectural decisions
- Regular architecture reviews
- Consider non-functional requirements early`

        content: `# Code Review Best Practices

## Introduction
Code reviews are a critical part of the software development process, ensuring code quality, knowledge sharing, and team collaboration.

## Benefits of Code Reviews

### Quality Assurance
- Catch bugs before they reach production
- Ensure code follows team standards
- Improve code readability and maintainability
- Validate test coverage

### Knowledge Sharing
- Spread knowledge across the team
- Share best practices and patterns
- Onboard new team members
- Document implicit knowledge

## Code Review Process

### 1. Preparation
- Ensure code compiles and tests pass
- Write clear commit messages
- Keep changes focused and small
- Self-review before requesting review

### 2. Review Request
- Provide context and background
- Explain complex changes
- Link to related issues or tickets
- Choose appropriate reviewers

### 3. Review Process
- Review within 24 hours
- Focus on logic, not style
- Ask questions, don't just criticize
- Approve when ready

## What to Look For

### Functionality
- Does the code solve the problem?
- Are edge cases handled?
- Is error handling appropriate?
- Are there any security concerns?

### Code Quality
- Is the code readable and maintainable?
- Are there any code smells?
- Is the code following team conventions?
- Are there opportunities for refactoring?

### Testing
- Are there adequate tests?
- Do tests cover edge cases?
- Are tests readable and maintainable?
- Is test coverage appropriate?

## Best Practices

### For Authors
- Keep changes small and focused
- Write clear commit messages
- Respond to feedback constructively
- Be open to suggestions

### For Reviewers
- Be respectful and constructive
- Focus on the code, not the person
- Explain the reasoning behind suggestions
- Approve when criteria are met

### For Teams
- Establish clear review criteria
- Set expectations for review time
- Use automated tools where possible
- Regular retrospectives on the process`
